# State and Props


## React lifecycle

### React: Component Lifecycle Events

React let you define its components as a functions or classes, the methods that you define in these called lifecycle events.<br>
These events can be called during the component life cycle to update the UI and applications states.<br>

### Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
the render will happen first.

### What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
Calling the constructor and creating the instances.

### Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates :
- Constructor 
- render
- React Updates
- componentDidMount
- componentWillUnmount

### What does componentDidMount do?
This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/IYvD9oBCuJI/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/IYvD9oBCuJI)

### What types of things can you pass in the props?
- inital value of a counter
- static values that are not gonna change
### What is the big difference between props and state?
props are handled outside of the component and states are handled in the componenmt.
props are being passed to the component.

### When do we re-render our application?
when we have updated the states
### What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
- the counter value in a counting application
- any value that gonna be handled in the component it self and in it only
