# REST

## Who is Roy Fielding?
His name is on the specification for the HTTP protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.
He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does
## Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.
## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern
## What does a GET do?
getting a resource from a url. Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using GET
## What does a POST do?
 add something from a system to another system
## What does PUT do?
replace something from a system to another system
## What does PATCH do?
update something from a system to another system
