# React and Forms
HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.

## What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
typically Controlled Components maintain their own state and update it based on user input
## Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
we should update the state with  the user's responce when they submit the form to prevent our react app from crashing because otherwise the app will re-render with each input
## How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
 this.setState({value: event.target.value} inside the event handler 
this.state.value for targeting current value

## Why would we use a ternary operator?
to Shorten the **if statements** into one line of code with the conditional operator
## Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
``` 
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} 
else {
  console.log(false);
}
```
**Solution :**

```
x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
```
