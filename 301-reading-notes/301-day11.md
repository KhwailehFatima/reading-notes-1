# Mongo and Mongoose

## Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>SQL</th>
      <th>No-SQL</th>
    </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
     <tr>
       <td>Relational Databases (RDBMS)</td>
       <td>non-relational or distributed database</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>table based databases</td>
       <td>document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td> predefined schema</td>
       <td>dynamic schema for unstructured data</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data</td>
       <td>queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database</td>
     </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment

## Give a real world example.
Microsoft

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data

## Give a real world example.
Facebook
## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
No SQL

## Which type of database is best for scalability?
depends on the application requirements

## What does SQL stand for?
structured query language

## What is a relational database?
works with certain assumptions or in a certain way and it supports the SQ language

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?
Tables 

## What is a ‘schema’?
very strict requirements for the data we store

## What is a NoSQL database?
it is build to store a lot of data in a very effecient way 

## How does it work?
it uses the collection and document base to store the data - inside a document, you don't have to follow the same schema

## What is inside of a Mongo database?
collections --> documents -->data sets
## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
MongoDB, because you don't need to define the stored data type in advance

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
rely less on the relations so you might have some duplicated data and if you have to update the data you need to update it in all of the collections individually
