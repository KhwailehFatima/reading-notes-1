## What is a ‘call’?
function invocation
## How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
1 in synchronous programming
## What does LIFO mean?
Last In First Out
## Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
```
function firstFunction(){
  throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');
}

function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
}

function thirdFunction(){
  secondFunction();
}

thirdFunction();
```

function 3 invoked --> call function 2 --> call function 1
## What causes a Stack Overflow?
A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

## What is a ‘reference error’?
when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared, it is also a common thing when using const and let
## What is a ‘syntax error’?
this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.
## What is a ‘range error’?
Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length
## What is a ‘type error’?
Like the name indicates, this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.
## What is a breakpoint?
it's like to stop excuting code during debugging
## What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
it lets the code has more tools to watch and fetch data and variables during excution
