# Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice

>The mistake most weak pianists make is playing, not practicing. If you walk into a music hall at a local university, you’ll hear people ‘playing’ by running through their pieces. This is a huge mistake. Strong pianists drill the most difficult parts of their music, rarely, if ever playing through their pieces in entirety.

## The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:

- Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
- Repeated often
- Feedback on results in continuously available
- It's highly demanding mentally
- It's difficult
- It requires good goals

# Assessing Bias

- After being a team leader for the 301 final project, I have discovered that I may have a little bit of struggling or misunderstanding with a lazzy person or reliance person
- I had a great insights about my team, but yet I had some issues to put all of us on the same page
- Thinking that leading a team of various races and backgrounds would not be that hard, but after experiencing it, IT IS HARD.
- You need to stay focused on being professional more than being needy to finish the requiered work !
